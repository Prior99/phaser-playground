# Phaser Playground #

The [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) Playground allows you to code games in your browser without having to download or install anything.

It's powered by [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), the code editor behind [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode).


### Running the application

    yarn start

Open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your favourite browser.


### Building the application

    yarn build

Having the `-p` option enabled will build the application for production use.
